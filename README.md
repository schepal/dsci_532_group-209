# Group 209 App

[Dashboard](https://dsci-532-group-209-3.herokuapp.com/)  

## App Description
The app’s landing page will include a heatmap representing the map of the world, that shows the proportion of an alcoholic drink consumed by each country, relative to the total alcohol consumption of the country, and a bar chart of the top 20 countries with the highest proportion of the alcoholic drink consumed. The user will be able to filter the map based on three alcoholic drinks: Beer, Wine and Spirits, and six regions: World, Asia, Europe, Americas, Africa and Oceania, using a drop-down list for each category. Once a drink is selected by the user, the map’s color scheme will update based on the drink, and the map will update to show the data relevant to the drink chosen. Above the map, there will be a legend showing the proportion of the drink consumed, using a color scale. As the map is a heatmap, the countries are color coded based on the level of the proportion of the alcoholic drink consumed. A user will be able to change the view of the map, by selecting a region, as the map will zoom into the region selected. The bar chart will update the top 20 countries based on the region selected, to ensure the countries are in the region. The map in the app is interactive, by hovering over a country, a square tooltip will appear, showing the country’s name, the proportion of the drink consumed, the total servings of the drink consumed and the country’s global and continent rank of proportion, compared to the other countries.  With the app, users will be able to discover and compare the drinking preferences of the countries of the world.    

## Functionality
Users are able to interactively engage with the dashboard by adjusting the cells of the alcohol type and respective geographic location of interest.
