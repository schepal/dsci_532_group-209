# Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

According to a [study](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/beer-market) conducted by Allied Market Research, the global beer market is projected to reach a valuation of nearly $700 billion by 2025. Despite this massive market for alcoholic beverages, the industry is extremely competitive with large corporations dominating the majority of consumer market share. Amid this aggressive competition, the companies who best understand their customers and modify their marketing strategies accordingly will become the most successful.

Visualizing the insights of global alcohol consumption statistics from a simple app can provide tangible value for companies operating in this industry. Marketing managers and corporate executives can use our app to assess which geographic regions are the fastest growing and most relevant for product expansion. Our app will save users time from analyzing raw data and instead provide a visually aesthetic global heat map of key alcohol consumption statistics within the sub-categories of beer, wine and spirits.


## Section 2: Description of the data

Our group has chosen to use a dataset describing the alcoholic consumption of 193 countries in the year 2010. We sourced the data from FiveThirtyEight ([source](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption)), who used it for an article they wrote titled, ["Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/).

FiveThirtyEight collected the data from the "World Health Organisation, Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH), 2010." WHO tracks this data as part of its global monitoring of alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harm and policy responses. According to FiveThirtyEight, WHO collected the data using "government records as well as statistics from the alcohol industry and the United Nationâ€™s Food and Agriculture Organization database."

The current dataset has 5 variables and 193 observations. The variables are:

- `country`
- `beer_servings`
- `spirit_servings`
- `wine_servings`
- `total_litres_of_pure_alcohol`

The dataset contains one observation for each country. The 4 associated variables describe the average alcohol consumption per capita for those age 15 in each country in the year 2010.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|`beer_servings`|average number of **cans of beer** consumed per person in 2010|
|`spirit_servings`|average number of **shots of spirits** consumed per person in 2010|
|`wine_servings`|average number of **glasses of wine** consumed per person in 2010|
|`total_litres_of_pure_alcohol`|average **liters of pure alcohol** consumed per person in 2010|

We will also be using a secondary dataset called `ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes` ([source](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes)) to help with the creation of our visuals. We will merge two columns from this data source to our dataset on alcoholic consumption: `region` and `sub-region`.

Finally, we will derive 4 new variables that will help uncover new insights about alcoholic consumption that are often missed by other analysis of the same dataset. For example, most analysis focuses on countries that consume the most beer / wine / spirits, but we can use the `prop_*` variables described below to uncover other trends, like countries that *love* a particular alcohol type more than others.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|`total_servings`|the total of `beer_servings`, `spirit_servings`, and `wine_servings`|
|`prop_beer`|the proportion of `total_servings` that comes from `beer_servings` |
|`prop_spirit`|the proportion of `total_servings` that comes from `spirit_servings` |
|`prop_wine`|the proportion of `total_servings` that comes from `wine_servings` |

## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

**Research questions:**
1. Which countries could be considered "beer-lovers", "wine-lovers", or "spirit-lovers"?
2. Are there any interesting trends or patterns between the type of alcohol consumed and the geographic region?

**Usage scenarios:**
- TBD
